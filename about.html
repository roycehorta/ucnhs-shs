                        <p>The events of the past 77 years in the history of Urdaneta City National High School reflect how a man struggles to realize his dreams.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           January 23, 1945, became a landmark in the educational history of Urdaneta and the Philippines as well. It was the foundation of the first public high school outside any provincial capital. Two weeks after the American forces landed at Lingayen Gulf after WWII, from an erroneous assumption that Urdaneta was a "city," Captain Jack Kramer, who headed the Philippine Civilian Army Unit(PCAU)of the Armed Forces of the United States, directed Dr. Pedro T. Orata, through Mayor Mariano Moreno to become the Director of Education and to re-open the elementary schools in the "City of Urdaneta."
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           This particular accident error turned out to be a tremendous educational blessing for the people of Urdaneta. Dr. Orata, in a flash of inspiration, took his cue from the organizational set-up in the cities of the US and organized a high school in addition to re-establishing the elementary school. He also named Mr.Francisco Parayno as superintendent of schools and Mr. Felipe Taaca as principal of the Elementary School of Urdaneta. Mr. Federico Lachica, his right-hand man, was appointed principal of the high school, his pet project. Thus began a revolution in secondary education that reverberated through the whole archipelago.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           In the non-credit vocational courses(off-campus offerings), bareback slippers and bag-making were handled by fourteen artisans trained under Mr. Dalmacio Israel. It was a sort of apprenticeship training. Their products were sold at the school's Retail Store, managed by Mr. Pio del Castillo. Mrs. Eulalia A. Bongolan handled the dressmaking offering.
                        </p>
                           <br>
                        <p>
                           By March of the same year, when the enrolment of students and recruitment of teachers finally stopped, the classes were moved to the De Leon Building opposite the southwest corner of the public market. The enrolment reached a total of 585, handled by 32 teachers. From then on, enrolment increased.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           Since 1945, UCNHS has changed, and it was a tremendous change. While many private secondary schools have sprouted in the city, she has maintained her status as one of the best secondary schools in the province. During the 60s American Field Scholars from UCNHS were sent to the different parts of the United States. The official school paper, The Beacon, started its publication with Mrs. Corazon A. Sunga as the first adviser, and later, the Filipino issue, Ang Tanglaw, came out. Students not only excelled in academics but also in athletics (many best athletes in the region I came from UCNHS). Trophies and medals (gold, silver, bronze) started pouring in.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           The 80s and the 90s placed UCNHS in the limelight. She collected almost all beauty titles in press conferences, athletic meets, science fairs, and other beauty contests. Innovation in the academic instruction and physical facilities was undertaken. The use of media was gradually introduced. Remedial instruction in Mathematics and Reading was adopted. Teachers were sent to a seminar for professional development.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           UCNHS hosted many national, regional, and division affairs and event-the National Secondary School Press Conference in 1989, Ilocos Region Athletic Association Meets, Division Athletic Meets, press conferences, and other academic meetings and contests. She became the Regional Leader School (RLS) for Technology and Home Economics (THE) during the implementation of the Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP) and the Division Leader School (DLS) of Pangasinan II for English, Filipino, THE, and PEHM.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           Another breakthrough in the history of UCNHS is the opening of the Science class in 1996, which started with two sections in the first year (Pasteur and Pascal). The first graduates were 35 (27 from Einstein and eight from Franklin) out of the 80 students who entered the first year.
                        </p>
                        <br>                           
                        <p>
                           The principal who gave their level best to make the school an ideal place for learning and was instrumental in producing quality graduates from 1945 were Mr. Federico Lachica, Mr. Isidro Fabia, Mr.Ingracio Velasco, Mr. Lino Caringal Sr., Mrs. Belen P. Magat, Mrs. Remedios Z. San Juan(OIC), and Mrs. Elvira C. Nabor.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           UCNHS is far different from what used to be a sawali classroom in the 40s. Buildings have started emerging. New facilities and amenities increased, and others were improved. Donations of laboratory equipment and instructional materials poured in from USAID, including computer units from the Special Science Class in 1997. the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) also donated 20 units of computers in 2001. Other donations and improvements to the school were achieved through the GOs, NGOs, and alumni.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           From having just only 585 student-enrollees handled by 32 teachers, we now had roughly over 5000+ students and 200+ teaching personnel. In 1946, classes were held in a building that had previously served as an evacuation hospital before being relocated to a donated 10-hectare lot, which has remained the school's central location. Its name was changed from Community High School to Urdaneta City National High School, as implied by Dr. Pedro T. Orata.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           Urdaneta City National High School continues to strive for excellence in youth's academic and social development. We are shaping future generations to be globally competitive for the world to see.
