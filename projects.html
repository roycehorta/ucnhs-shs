                 <div class="project-content">
                    <p>From the 15th to November 19, the "A Book with a Heart" project was conducted at UCNHS, wherein SSG Organization collaborated with the SHS's English and Filipino faculty, which aimed to collect books and school supplies for daycare students of a chosen rural area.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After the collection of donations, on December 03, 2021, the organization proceeded on the donation drive at Barangay Cabaruan Day Care Center, wherein the incoming pupils were given fairytale/storybooks, pencils, papers, and notebooks which could be a less burden for their families to provide new learning resources most especially that in our new normal, prices rose as crucial materials were highly in demand.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Emphasizing the less privileged families with incoming daycare students at their homes known as our "Pag-asa ng Bayan," the book donation drive made great value to them with the modest help provided, we believe.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Without taking any additional risks, through their conjoined project, the said organization hopefully made those children know to read so that they would read to know.

                            The project duration is within 75 calendar days, funded by the Parent-Teachers Association or PTA with a contract cost of Php 1,299,821.92. The project was deliberated during the general assembly of parents of 5000+ students of Urdaneta City National High School, junior high school, and Senior High School.

                            The School Project would not have been possible without the help of parents and students who contributed and paid for the project's construction. The pathway aims to provide quality roads for the students, especially when there is rain. Finally, they will no longer suffer from the flood after the project is finished.
